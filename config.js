	// Your love letter (multi-line supported)
	loveNote: `ðŸŒ¹ Happy Birthday, My Love ðŸŒ¹
Today is your special day, and even though Iâ€™m not by your side the way I wish I could be, my heart is wrapped around yours tighter than ever.
I want to say thank youâ€”for being my sunshine on stormy days, for believing in me when I couldnâ€™t believe in myself, and for standing by me with a love so pure it humbles me.
Iâ€™m truly sorry I couldnâ€™t be there to celebrate you the way you deserve. No gifts, no surprisesâ€”but please know, if love could be wrapped in ribbons, youâ€™d be drowning in it.
I promise you, when I have the means, Iâ€™ll make up for every missed moment. Not just with gifts, but with memories, laughter, and the kind of love that never fades.
You are my greatest treasure, and every day with you feels like a gift I didnâ€™t deserve but somehow got lucky enough to receive.
I love you more than words can hold, and Iâ€™m counting the days until I can show you just how much.
Happy Birthday, my queen ðŸ‘‘ðŸ’–`,
